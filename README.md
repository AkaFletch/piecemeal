# Piecemeal
I eat chess pieces.

## A sub par chess engine

I'm just messing around with the idea of a chess engine written in go. I think I'm going to start with a basic search tree using a Monte Carlo search tree with UCT. I may try enable Parallelization over the search tree at some point who knows.

## Building

To build the executable run:

```
go build cmd/piecemeal/piecemeal.go
```
